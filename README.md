# kapoki

Quickly generate skeletons for your programming projects.

## 1. Install it

```bash
make
```

## 2. Create a project

```bash
kapoki ~/projects/web_server ~/.kapoki/cpp
#      <project_name>        <path_to_template>
```

Now you'll have a `~/projects/web_server/` directory with a C++ template inside it.
